Therefore its best if you self host with a NAS, plus a NAS has many benifits for example Video streaming of your own files (Be your own netflix), and you can backup family fotos/videoes.

There a many NAS servers out there big and small, find one that fits you

-[NAS servers (AMAZON)](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=NAS)
